# BackEnd
## Objective:
This project had the objective to create and learn about how FastAPI work. Since, I wanted to use as little extern tools as possible.

# FrontEnd
## Objective:
With this part of the project, my concern is to learn how JS works in it's most pure form, since I want to use this as a start to use frameworks later.
